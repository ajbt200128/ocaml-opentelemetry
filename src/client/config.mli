    @param url
      base url used to construct per-signal urls. Per-signal url options take
      precedence over this base url. Default is "http://localhost:4318", or
      "OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT" if set.

    Example of constructed per-signal urls with the base url
    http://localhost:4318
    - Traces: http://localhost:4318/v1/traces
    - Metrics: http://localhost:4318/v1/metrics
    - Logs: http://localhost:4318/v1/logs

    Use per-signal url options if different urls are needed for each signal
    type.

    @param url_traces
      url to send traces, or "OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT" if set. The
      url is used as-is without any modification.

    @param url_metrics
      url to send metrics, or "OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_ENDPOINT" if set. The
      url is used as-is without any modification.

    @param url_logs
      url to send logs, or "OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_LOGS_ENDPOINT" if set. The url is

      constructed {!t}.

      Typically this is used to extend the constructor for {!t} with new
      optional arguments.

      E.g., we can construct a configuration that includes a {!t} alongside a
      more specific field like so:

      {[
        type extended_confg =
          { new_field: string
          ; common: t
          }

        let make : (?new_field -> unit) make =
          Env.make (fun common ?new_field () -> {new_field; common})

        let _example : extended_config =
          make ~new_field:"foo" ~url_traces:"foo/bar" ~debug:true ()
      ]}

      As a special case, we can get the simple constructor function for {!t}
      with [Env.make (fun common () -> common)] *)

    values from the environment, provide stateful configuration setting and
